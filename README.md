Program that provides the shortest path between an array of any two celestial objects 

To Test Edge List Implementation of StarNavigator:
MainEdgeList.cpp uses EdgeList.cpp, EdgeList.h, Star.h, and hygdata_v3.csv.  Compile all files into a single folder; running the MainEdgeList.cpp file prompts the user to input an integer within the provided range and outputs the minimum distance to the input star based on its ID.

To Test Adjacency List Implementation:
AdjacencyMain.cpp incorporated all classes into a main function.  Download only AdjacencyMain.cpp and hygdata_v3.csv to run. User input is done the same as in the Edge List.
